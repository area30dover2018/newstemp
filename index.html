<p><strong><em>Michael Jordan</strong></em></p>
<p>Michael Jordan was born Feb 17, 1963
    He lived in NY, and Brooklyn. Now when he was drafted in 1984, he was in the first round of the NBA draft he was chosen by the Chicago Bulls and then he left the Bulls and went to the Wizards then came back to the Bulls and he played a little baseball he wasn’t good at that. When Jordan made his final shot for the Chicago Bulls 20 years ago next month, that question was easy to answer.
    While a cases could be made for players based on championship rings, it was clear: Jordan was the greatest basketball player who had ever lived.  Now MJ has been retired since  2003!   School: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is where he went to college where he later went to the NBA then he became well known to the basketball world.

<strong><em><p>Lebron James</p></strong></em>
  <p>But came Lebron James now James was born the same year that (MJ) was drafted into the NBA 1984 that goes to show you the age difference between the two players when one first started the other one was being born and Lebron has said in the past I was inspired by MJ and I’ll give it to him he is really talented when it comes to the sport of basketball. He was drafted in the same year that MJ retired that would be 2003 he was number one picked in the first round of the draft by the to the Heat then the Cleveland cavaliers he went to college at ST. Vincent High school that means he didn’t even play college ball he got so much attention in high school then went to the draft of the NBA</p>

<strong><em><h2>The way players work!</h2><strong></em>
    <p>all basketball players try to be the best at no matter what position they play rather it’s SF, PF, PG, or even SG. All the NBA player’s try to do there best during the game they tire to beat there opponent every time,
       and at practice. They say treat practice like a game cause if you don’t how are you going to get better at it like ball handling go as hard and as fast as you can and I mean to where to you. Lose the ball cause if you aren’t losing the ball you’re not trying and that means you’re
       not going to get any better so try. And if MJ and Lebron were here with us they would agree with this if you want to get better at one on one play against someone who is better than you because if you dont the what is the point and,
       sometimes you’ll feel you want to quit that doesn’t quit that means your trying and keep doing it cause, you just got to remember game day is this Thursday or if you’re a varsity player Friday and if your, good Saturday. REMBER there’s county, sectionals, then regionals, etc.</p>

<p>So, both players have good advice for kids and younger players because they are good role models for kids.</p>
<p>Now we know that they care about kids and people they are role modles to but every star player has a partner and that is what makes them so good at what they do
because without the partner they wouldn't make as many points or win as many games. </p>
