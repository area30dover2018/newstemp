<p><strong><em>So is it Michael Jordan?</em></strong></p>
     <div class="story">
       <p>Michael Jordan a.k.a. MJ was born Feb 17, 1963
       He lived in NY, and Brooklyn. Now when he was drafted in the year 1984, he was in the top three of the first round of the NBA draft he was chosen by the Chicago Bulls and he was really good then he left the Bulls and went to the Wizards but then came back to the Bulls and he played a little baseball he wasn’t good at that. When Michael Jordan made his final shot for the Chicago Bulls 20 years ago next month, that question was easy to answer.
       While cases could be made for players like Bill Russell based on championship rings, Wilt Chamberlain on statistical dominance and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on longevity, the consensus was clear: Jordan was the greatest basketball player who had ever lived.  Now MJ has been retired since the year 2003!   School: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is where he went to college where he later went to the NBA then he became well known to the basketball world.

<p><strong><em>Or is it Lebron James?</em></strong></p>
  <div class="story">
<p>But came Lebron James. James was born the same year that (MJ) was drafted into the NBA 1984 that goes to show you the age difference between the players when one started when the other one was being born and Lebron has said in the past I was inspired by MJ and I’ll give it to him he is really talented when it comes to the sport. He was drafted in the same year that MJ retired 2003 he was number one picked in the first round of the draft by the HEAT.
he now plays for the LAKERS he went to ST. Vincent High school he didn’t even play college ball he got so much attention in high school then went to the draft of the NBA.</p>
